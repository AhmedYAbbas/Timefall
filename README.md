# Timefall
Welcome to the repository for my game engine project! This README will provide an overview of the project, and its current status.

## Overview
 Timefall Enigne is a work in progress inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT">The Cherno's tutorial series</a>. The goal of this project is to create a powerful and flexible game engine that can be used to develop a wide range of games.

## Current Status
As mentioned earlier, this project is in its early work-in-progress stage. I have successfully implemented some fundamental components, including:

- **Events:** Including MouseEvents, KeyboardEvents, WindowEvents.
- **Logging:** Basic Logging system that prints to the console.
- **Layers:** Layers system to associate actions to only specific layers.
- **Input Handling:** Basic input handling for user interaction with the game.
- **Basic Rendering:** Rendering system using a rendering API (OpenGL) to display graphics on screen.

Please note that while these components are functional, they may lack advanced features and optimizations.
